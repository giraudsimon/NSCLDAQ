/*!
   This class is  the thread that is the main application startup thread.
   We have to do a bunch of initialization:
   - Set up the initial run state.
   - Set up the Tcl Interpreter and its commands for the main
     program.
   - Start the output thread
   - Start the Tcl Server thread.
   - Pass control to the Tcl event loop.

   Due to the way Spectrodaq clients work, we are not able to make a pure
   singleton object with private constructors, because we will need to
   make a static instantiation of the object.  However that static instance
   provides us with the handles we need to get the tcl interpreter started and
   extended.   There will be more comments about this in startTcl and
   AppInit().
   
   Since the lifetime of this application is the lifetime of the program,
   storage management will be a bit sloppy.
