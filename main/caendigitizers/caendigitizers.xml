            Support for a limited set of CAEN digitizers running either DPP-PHA
            or DPP-PSD firmware by CAEN and has been contributed back to
            NSCLDAQ as of version 12.0.

       <title>Overview</title>
       <para>
            Support for the CAEN digitizers is provided through classes that
            allow the SBSreadout skeleton to read data from synchronized sets
            of these digitizers.  Separate class sets have been made availabl for
            the DPP-PHA and DPP-PSD digitizers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each of these digitizers has a large number of parameters that must be
        set up properly to optimize pulse processing performed on-board.
        CAEN supplies a setup/acquisition tool called COMPASS which can be
        used to configure these parameters and see the effect of parameter
        set choices on spectra produced by the digitizers.
       </para>
       <para>
        COMPASS is available for free download from <ulink url='http://caen.it' />.
        COMPASS can work with single digitizers or with groups of digitizers and
        can be used to create parameter sets for synchronized sets of digitizers.
        These parameter sets are written to XML configuration files.
       </para>
       <para>
        The NSCLDAQ support classes set up the digitizers they manage by processing
        the XML configuration files that were written by COMPASS.   These configuration
        files are processed at the start of each run, allowing the digitizer settings
        to be modified beteween runs.
       </para>
       <para>
         Data from digitizers consists of a sequence of time ordered events from
         each independent digitizer.  Each digitizer event represents data from
         a single channel.  Channel events are timestamped.  The sorted event
         streams from each digitizer must be merged into a single time ordered
         stream of channel events and then coincident events built into meaningful
         events.
       </para>
       <para>
          The NSCL Event builder was created for exactly that purpose.  THerefore,
          when the SBS readout program has been tailored to read CAEN digitizer
          events, each digitizer card is assigned a unique source id.  This
          allows the NSCL Event builder to merge and glom events across
          all digitizers.  
       </para>
       <para>
        We will say more about the special requirements for using the SBS readout
        program with the NSCLDAQ Event builder in a later chapter.

        This chapter describes how to create a version of the SBS readout program
        that can setup and read data from the DPP-PHA digitizers.  The steps you
        need to follow are roughly:

           <para>
              Use CAEN COMPASS to setup the digitizers, including using its
              synchronization wizard to set up several digitizers to run in
              a synchronized manner.  This part of the procedure is beyond the
              scope of this document.

          <title>Obtaining a copy of the DPP-PHA skeleton.</title>
          <para>
            If you've set up the environment variables for the version of
            NSCLDAQ you are using, you can get a copy of the DPP-PHA skeleton
            code by creating a new empty directory, making it your current working
            directory and issuing the command:
          </para>
          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
cp $DAQROOT/skeletons/dpp-pha/* .
            </programlisting>
          </informalexample>
          <para>
            This should result in the following files:

            <para>
                The readout requirements of the CAEN DPP digitizers are
                unique enough that you cannot mix reading out the CAEN digitizers
                with non-CAEN digitizers in a single Readout program.  What you
                can do, however is read CAEN Digitizers via the CONET fiber optic
                link and have a second readout program read the non CAEN DPP
                digitizers via a VME controller from the same VME crate using,
                an SBS VME bus bridge or VMUSBReadout with a VM-USB controller.

                Once you've copied the skeleton, you can optionally build it
                to create an empty readout:

            In this chapter we will take alook at the edits you will have to
            make to the <filename>Skeleton.cpp</filename> file to create an
            actual working Readout program.  As you look at the existing file,
            note that it is an example of a fully functional readout. Therefore
            you'll need to remove/modify existing as well as to add new lines of
            code.

          <title>Structure of data read by the DPP-PHA skeleton</title>
          <para>
            This section describes the format of the data readout by the DPP-PHA
            readout program.  Note that usually, individual channel hits are
            assembled into events using the NSCL event builder.  The wrapping
            of data by the  NSCL Event builder is beyond the scope of this document.
            See the NSCLDAQ event builder documentation for that information.
          </para>
          <para>
            Before going into the event structure in detail, a note about timestamps.
            The V725 and V730 boards have a different timestamp clock rate.
            The readout framework adjusts the timestamps from both boards
            so that the event is tagged with a timestamp in nanoseconds.  This
            allows the event builder to properly build data from these boards
            (and e.g. XIA DDAS boards as well) correctly).
          </para>
          <para>
            Here's a text picture of the structure of each hit's body:  Note that
            the body header contains the source id, which in turn tells you

                    This is not the raw time tag from the digitizer.
                    The digitizer has a 32 bit timestamp with
                    an optional 16 bit extension that could be
                    put in the one of the extras (see below).
                    This timestamp can only cover a relatively short
                    period of time (a few seconds).  Therefore,
                    the readout program tracks wrap arounds (this is
                    fine as long as there are not two wraps between
                    hits), and calibrates the resulting tag to
                    nanoseconds.  This value is the 64 bit nanosecond
                    timestamp that also accounts for raw stamp
                    rollovers.

                    In addition to the results of the DPP algorithm,
                    extra words can be included in the data
                    depending on how the digitizer is configured.
                    These two words are called Extras 1 and
                    Extras 2. Their contents depend on how you've

                    Waveform data may also be completely

          <para>
            The digitizer can record two waveforms per channel.
            The contents of these waveforms depends on the
            digitizer configuration. The waveform packet
            begins with a uint32_t that contains the number of
            samples in each trace (if there are two traces both
            have the same number of samples).  If no traces
            are recorded, this value is 0.
          </para>
          <para>
            Following the number of samples is a dual trace flag.
            This is present even if no waveforms are being recorded.
            This flag is nonzero if waveforms are being recorded
            and there will be two of them.  Otherwise, this flag
            is zero.

                    value per sample.  Naturally, if the number of
                    samples is zero, there will be no data words here.

                    This packet is only present if the dual trace
                    flag is nonzero.  It contains the second trace.
                    Note, once more this contains a 16 bit integer
                    per trace value.  This is omitted if the  number
                    of samples is zero or the dual trace flag is
                    zero but the number of samples is

            Compass or not well supported by the implementation at this
            time.  Once the digitizer is configured but before it is

       <title>Creating event segments for DPP-PSD digitizers</title>
       <para>
        The DPP-PSd firmware allows CAEN digitizers to perform
        pulse shape discrimination.  This involves integrating
        the background subtracted pulse within two integration
        windows, a short and a long window.
       </para>
       <para>
        This chapter will describe how to create event segments for
        the DPP-PSD firmware in CAEN x730 and x725 modules.  While
        it is possible to mix DPP-PSD and DPP-PHA modules it is not
        possible to mix CAEN DPP modules with other types of
        modules in the same Readout program.  Mixing
        DPP-PSD and DPP-PHA modules will be described in the
        next chapter.

            <para>
                The DPP-PSD readout is a specialized version of the SBS readout
                skeleton.  An event segment class has been written to support
                individual board and an over-arching event segment manages the
                collection of boards in the system.  
            </para>
            <para>
                To obtain the skeleton readout program create an empty
                directory and cd into it then, if the DAQROOT environment
                variable points to the top level installation directory
                of your NSCLDAQ installation:

            Normally the Makefile provided with the skeleton is sufficient and
            does not require modification.  This is because the CAEN digitizers
            are multi-event buffered devices and it's not supported to
            operate them in conjunction with other devices.  An actual
            event might be read out in response to several re-triggerings

           <title>Event format from the DPP-PSD readout.</title>
           <para>
            This section describes the format for each hit
            (channel event) from the PSD digitizers.  Normally,
            hits are sent to an event builder where they are wrapped
            in event builder headers and bundled into events
            that consist of hits that have occured within some
            time period of a first hit.
           </para>
           <para>
            This section will describe the raw body of hits
            produced by the Readout program prior to event building.
            Each event is a ring item of type
            <literal>PHYSICS_EVENT</literal>.   These events
            have the standard body header that carries the
            timestamp and source id among other things.
            The actual body of the event follows the body header
            and has the following structure:

                    <para>
                        The timestamp in the raw hit from the digitizer
                        is 32 bits wide and is in digitizer
                        size specific units.   This has two problems.
                        First, 32 bits of timestamp only allow for
                        a few seconds of run time before the timestamp
                        rolls over.  Second, device specific units of
                        the raw timestamp would make event building
                        with a heterogeneous set of digitizers
                        impossible.  The event builder expects
                        all data sources to be running at the same
                        timestamp frequency.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The timestamp in the event body is computed
                        using wrap detection and a carry counter to
                        produce a true 64 bit timestamp in the
                        device units.   This timestamp is accurate
                        as long as the channel it comes from
                        does not roll over more than once between
                        hits.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The resulting timestamp is then multiplied by
                        the number of nanoseconds per digitizer
                        timestamp tick and the resulting timestamp
                        in nanoseconds is put into the event's body
                        header.   The event builder only cares
                        about the body header.  This allows all digitizers
                        to present timestamps with a common time base
                        (nanosecond units) to the event builder.

                    <para>
                        Note that the software supporting XIA
                        Pixie16 modules also presents body header
                        timestamps in nanosecond units making it
                        possible to directly build XIA and
                        CAEN digital data acquisition system event
                        fragments together.

                The remainder of the event structure should be
                self explanatory from the description of the
                digitizer, with the exception of the waveform
                data.  Note that the digitizer this hit came
                from can be deduced from the source id located
                in the hit's body header.

                in the top 16 bits, Flag information of some sort in bits
                10-15 and the bottom 10 bits (bits 0-9) the fine
                timestamp from the CFD.  We chose this so that we can
                unambiguously unpack a high precision time in SpecTcl e.g. for
                the computation of time differences as might be needed for time of
                flight parameters.  A later version will support the full set of

                        both traces have the same number of samples,

                        determination. A value of 2 means that the

        <title>Creating Readouts that mix DPP-PSD and DPP-PHA segments</title>

            There are two ways to mix DPP-PSD and DPP-PHA event segments.

               <para>
                  Use one readout program for the DPP-PHA digitizers
                  and a second for the DPP-PSD digitizers.
               </para>

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Use a single readout and combine the data from
                  both digitizers.
               </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            Note that whichever you choose, you must determine which
            of the digitizers is the master timing source on the
            daisy chain and configure both types of digitizers
            accordingly.  Using the COMPASS synchronization
            wizard can help you with this.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you use two readouts, you can stil have a common
            XML configuration file as both programs can locate
            their digitizers from within the XML configuration and
            will ignore digitizers they've not been told about.
        </para>
        <para>
            The remainder of this chapter will describe how to
            merge data from both digitizers into a single readout
            program.  Briefly here are the steps to follow:

       <title>Configuring the Event builder and ReadoutGUI to create events.</title>
       <para>
        CAEN Digitizer Readout programs treat each module in the sysem as a unique
        data source.   Each module produces a time ordered sequence of
        hits.  But the data read across modules does not guarantee a totally
        time ordered set of fragments across all modules in the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Treating each module as a separate data source requires a few special
        bits of handling when setting up the event builder.
       </para>
       <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
           <para>
              Since Readout only issues one Begin run and End run ring item, but has
              several data sources, the Readout program must be configured to
              not mark these records with a barrier type.  Otherewise at the
              start and end of each run, the event builder will stall on
              a barrier wait until there's a barrier timeout.
           </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
           <para>
              The source id given to the Readout program should match one of the
              module sourceids.  That ensures that the non physics hit ring items
              (Begin run, end run, pause run, esuem run, scaler, trigger count),
              are emitted with a source id that is one of the module sourceids.
              This is a best practice, you can use an additional source id just
              for those records.  See below, however.
           </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
           <para>
              The ring fragment source(s) for the event builder must be
              configured to accept data from all source ids their Readout's
              emit.
           </para>
        </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
       <para>
            Let's look at an example where the Readout program has
            three modules, configured for source id 1, 2 and 3.
            The Readout program must haved the following command line options
            specified in its data source specification in the ReadoutShell:

                   <para>
                    As usual this must be supplied and should specify
                    a ring buffer into which the raw hit data will be put.
                   </para>

               <listitem>
                   <para>
                    As a best practice, this should specify one of the
                    source ids (e.g. <literal>1</literal>) configured
                    for one of the module event segment objects.

                    Turns off barrier synchronization.
                    This must be specified for <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> readout
                    programs in the event builder, not just the CAEN ones.
                    If any Readout program doesn not have this flag, the
                    event builder will stall until a barrier timeout at all
                    run state transitions.

        <para>
            The ReadoutGUI's <filename>ReadoutCallouts.tcl</filename> file
            specifies both the use of the event builder and ring fragment

            them up and send them off to the event builder.
        </para>

            above (source ids 1,2,3), putting data in tcp://spdaq20/caenraw.
            We would need to register a ring fragment source as follows:

            Note how the source ids is a list of the source ids emitted
            by the Readout program.  We've also specified that the ring fragment
            source operates only for a single run.  This is suitable for cases

                    Some registers have an instance per channel.  These have
                    base addresses in the CAEN documentation that look like
                    <literal>anbc</literal> where, a,b,c are hex digits
                    and n is the literal n.  For these registers,
                    specify a base address of <literal>a0bc</literal> and set
                    this flag to be 1 to dump all 16 registers.

        </title>
        <para>
            For the most part, this material can be ignored by end users.
            This section is provided for completeness to document the set of
            classes and structs that form the support code.  
        </para>
        <para>
            This appendix is divided into two sections.  The first documents
            the DPP-PHA support clases and the second, the DPP-PSD support classes.
        
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>DPP-PHA support classes.</title>
            <para>
                The DPP-PHA support classes went through  couple of iterations.
                The first version was built to operate with the configuration files
                used by a discontinued CAEN Product called
                <literal>MC<superscript>2</superscript>A</literal>.  CAEN released the
                more functional COMPASS data acquisition tool.  The original
                customers then requested that the DPP-PHA support operate
                with the XML based configuration files written by that program.
            </para>
            <para>
                The original support therefore mostly still exists as a layer
                of code in this second iteration.  
            </para>
            <para>
                Note tht the pugixml library, included in the CAEN DPP support
                is used to do XML parsing.  For information about this
                library see

                        This class contains the configuration of one DPP-PHA
                        module.  Note that the processing/parsing parts of this
                        class are obsolete and no longer used. See

                                In the original support version that was based
                                on <command>MC2Analyzer</command>, only part of the
                                configuration was expressed by the textual
                                configuration files written for that program.
                                The additional configuration was read in via simple
                                XML configuration files.  This constructor
                                was coded for that purpose.  As such it is
                                deprecated.

                                <parameter>dom</parameter> is the parsed XML
                                file for the additional digitizer module level
                                configuration parameters not captured by MC2Analyzer.
                                <parameter>channelDoms</parameter> are the
                                parsed XML files for each enabled channel of the
                                digitizer containing per channel configuration
                                parameters not captured by MC2Analyzer's
                                configuration file.

                                Again, I want to stress that this constructor
                                is no longer used and is deprecated as we use
                                a different method to fill in this configuration
                                from COMPASS configuration files.

                                pulled configuration information out of the

                        a <classname>CAENPha</classname> object. The
                        object is configured using a matching module
                        in an XML configuration file produced by the
                        COMPASS data acquisition program from CAEN.

                        Before diving into the methods, a word
                        about COMPASS and COMPASS configuration files.
                        COMPASS is a CAEN data acquisition program
                        that can be used to optimize the configuration
                        of DPP-PHA and DPP-PSD digitizers.
                        COMPASS can run a group of synchronized digitizers
                        simultaneously and includes a wizard for
                        synchronizing the digitizers.
                        It writes
                        XML files that capture the configuration of the
                        digitizers it is running.

                        only operates a single digitizer.  The digitizer

                        The module has a set of counters, two per channel.

                        triggers.  It's possible to arrange for these

                        For CAEN Digitizer readouts, each trigger
                        should only produce one hit in a ring item.
                        If you are mixing together several CAEN-DPP
                        event segments, you need to put them
                        together using this compound event segment
                        class.  A typical use case is combining DPP-PHA
                        and DPP-PSD readouts.

                        After constructing the object, use

                        add the event segments you need.
                        The <methodname>read</methodname> method
                        responds to the trigger by asking its event segments
                        in a round robin way to contribute data.
                        Once data are contributed,
                        <methodname>read</methodname> stops and
                        remembers where it left off.  Fair
                        readout is done by responding to the next
                        trigger by first asking the next module
                        after the one most recently producing data
                        to contribute.  For this purpose, the
                        modules are treated as if they form a circular
                        list in the order in which they were
                        added to the segment.

                        This round robin scheme should prevent

                        opportunity to contribute data to the

                        This class allows you to build an
                        event segment out of a set of DPP-PSD Modules.  THe
                        segment is presumed to be a time-synchronized
                        daisy chain with a timing master and
                        several slaves.

                      <para>
                        Build the list by constructing the individual
                        module objects, constructing this class
                        and then invoking
                        <methodname>addModule</methodname>
                        to add each module object to the

                        When <methodname>initialize</methodname>
                        is called, each contained module
                        is asked to initialize.
                        The code then primes all the slave modules
                        to start and finally, starts the
                        timing master module.

                      <para>
                        There is nothing to stop you from building
                        an object consisting entirely of slaves.
                        This will most likely be done when using
                        <classname>COneOnlyEventSegment</classname>
                        to mix both DPP-PSD and DPP-PHA modules.
                        In that case, all slave modules will be
                        synchronized and when the timing master
                        in another segment is started, all will
                        start in a synchronized manner.

                      <para>
                        In a singles experiment, where timing
                        synchonization isn't important, you
                        can just as easily program all modules
                        as masters and all will start up but
                        unsynchronized.

                        method is invokded a fair, round robin
                        scheme is used to request data from
                        modules so that low rate modules will not
                        be starved by high rate modules.
                        This is done by treating the modules as
                        a cirular list and, after a module
                        hit is received, responding to the
                        next
                        <methodname>read</methodname> call by
                        starting to look for data beginning with the next
                        module in the object.

                                In a syncrhonized system, the start pulse travels down
                                the module daisy chain.  Because of propagation delays,
                                cable lengths and
                                the time it takes each module to output the
                                start after seeing it on the input,
                                each module will get the start pulse a little
                                later than the previous module on the daisy chain.

                                allows you to compensate for this timing skew
                                by programming a delay into each module between
                                receiving the start pulse and actually starting
                                (it's the start that zeroes a module's timestamp
                                counter).  By programming successively
                                longer delays as you go towards the
                                master module, you can get a much better
                                synchronization of the timestamp clear
                                in all modules.  Naturally, an external

                                and measured cables, makes this unecessary
