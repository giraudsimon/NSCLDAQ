    <title>Parallel programming framework</title>
    <para>
        There are many types of parallel programming.  One classic model
        for parallel programming is that of
        <firstterm>Communicating Sequential Processes</firstterm> (CSP).
        CSP models a parallel program as a set of sequential, or serial programs
        that talk to each other.  
    </para>
    <para>
        Within CSP two main models exist;

                    is internal to that system.

        NSCLDAQ provides a high level library that insulates your program
        from the detailed mechanisms of specific message passing libraries.
        Programs written that only communicate via message passing can be
        easily rehosted from a threaded implementation to a distributed
        implementation, changing only initialization code.

        <title>Concepts and classes</title>
        <para>
            Parallel programs build on top of this library consists of
            objects that communicate via messagse passing.  To limit the
            amount of data copying required, messages can, not only be
            a single block of data but can be a block list that's gathered
            by the library into a single message.
        </para>
        <para>
            The assumption is that a program consists of some source of data
            and that processing these data involve parcelling out work units
            to parallel processing objects. which then fan their
            results back in to processing objects that gather the  data.
        </para>
        <para>
            Thus the programming model has you stringing together a
            pipeline (each element of the pipeline runs in parallel) where
            stages of those pipelines may include stages that run multiple
            processors that operate in parallel on data streaming through the
            pipeline.
        </para>
        <para>
            The following classes, therefore, model several types of
            processing elements that can appear in these data/processing flows:
        </para>
        <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
                <term><classname>CDataSourceElement</classname></term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        These elements are intended to connect the
                        program to concrete sources of data.  In NSCLDAQ
                        these sources can be ring items, files or some
                        other communicating processor (internal or external).
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        These elements are normally at the start of the
                        processing pipeline.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>

                <term><classname>CDataSinkElement</classname></term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        These elements are intended to connect the program
                        to some concrete sink of data.  In NSCLDAQ, sinks can
                        be ring buffers, files or other communicating processors.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
                <term><classname>CParallelWorker</classname></term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        A generic parallel worker.  This is normally used
                        to encapsulate code that runs in the data parallel
                        segments of the computation.  Normally this
                        encapsulation 
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
        <para>
            From these classes you can see that the computation normally takes
            the form of a pipeline where data comes from a
            <classname>CDataSourceElement</classname> runs through
            several <classname>CParallelWorker</classname> elements
            and then in the end data is emitted from the program via
            a <classname>CDataSinkElement</classname>
        </para>
        <para>
            Having these classes is all well and good, but how do they communicate
            with each other?  Following the pipeline model, each element
            of the computation gets its data from
            a <classname>CReceiver</classname> and sends the results of its
            computation to the next stage of the pipeline
            via a <classname>CSender</classname>.
        </para>
        <para>
            <classname>CReceiver</classname> and
            <classname>CSender</classname> objects encapsulate another
            class derived from
            <classname>CTransport</classname>.  Transport classes are
            actual do the messaging required by the receiver and sender objects.
            In doing so, the contain code specific to the type communication
            library being used (e.g. MPI or ZeroMQ), and they also encapsulate
            a specific communication pattern.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some base classes for transports are:

                    <para>
                        The abstract base class for all transports.  This class
                        provides the interfaces used by sender and receiver
                        objects to request actual communication.

                        to the data transfer interfaces, this class
                        provides interfaces to inform the members of the
                        fanout that there is no more data available.

                        Abstract base class for transports that
                        get data from a fanout transport.  The model provided
                        requires that each client provide a unique integer
                        client identifier.  This class encapsulates interfaces
                        for both setting the id and communicating the id to the
                        other end of the transport.

        <para>
            Thuse the computation can be made up of processing elements that
            get and send data without actually knowing how that's done.  Program
            initialization can select actual transports and bind them into
            processing elements.  If necessary, program initialization can also
            allocate processors to computing resources.
            This allows a computation to be rehosted without the actual
            computing elements being aware of the process.

                The goal here is not to get into the nitty gritty of ZMQ
                socket types used in the various transports, but to describe
                facilities available to assist you in setting up ZMQ based
                parallel programs.

                One facility the library provides is a factory that provides
                you with transport factories for the specific communication
                system you are using.   The factory knows how to create
                transports for communication patterns implemented on top of
                a specific transport library.
            </para>
            <para>
                The <classname>CCommunicatorFactoryMaker</classname>
                singleton class represents this factory of factories.  The
                code fragment below shows how to get a communication
                factory for ZMQ communications:
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>
#include &lt;CCommunicatorFactoryMaker.h&gt;
#include &lt;CCommunicatorFactory.h&gt;
..
..
CCommunicatorFactory* pZmqFactory = CCommunicatorFactoryMaker::getInstance()-&gt;
    create("ZeroMQ CommunicationSystem");
if (!pZmqFactory) {
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "ZEROMQ factory not in the factory of factories\n";
    exit(-1);
}
....

                </programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                One problem that needed solving to provide a generic
                communicator factory was how to identify communication endpoints.
                For example a raw TCP/IP socket uses a host/port pair to
                identify an end point, ZMQ uses an URI to identify end endpoint
                and so on.
            </para>
            <para>
                Communicator factories use unsigned integers to identify
                endpoints.  While this maps directly to e.g. MPI ranks,
                there must be a mechanism for the ZMQ factory to map these
                identifiers onto URIs.
            </para>
            <para>
                This is done by you, providing one or more zmq service map files.
                A zmq service map file is a text file.  Lines beginning with
                <literal>#</literal> are ignored as are lines that consist
                only of whitespace.  Leading and trailing whitespace are also
                ignored.
            </para>
            <para>
                Mapping lines, consist of two fields. The first is an integer
                transport id and the second is the ZMQ URI that will be used
                when that transport endpoint is selected. For example;
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <literallayout>
    1 tcp://somenode.in.my.network:1234
                </literallayout>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                Maps the transport identifier <literal>1</literal> to  a TCP
                transport with an endpoing of port number <literal>1234</literal>
                whose server is in a
                system named <literal>somenode.in.my.network</literal>.
            </para>
            <para>
                We therefore need to know, additionally, which transports are
                servers and which are clients.

                Using the common base classes, derived classes that do
                MPI messaging have been built to provide the same
                communications pattern.  In this case, the endpoint IDs
                are simply MPI ranks.
            </para>
            <para>
                While we compile against OpenMPI, any MPI implementation
                should work.   Note that usually MPI programs must be run
                using a helper program.  For exmaple in OpenMPI you must
                use <command>mpirun</command> to start an mpi application.

                It is possible to write programs that can, at run-time
                select the appropriate communication framework.
                Several NSCLDAQ utilities have been written in this way and
                you can study their initialization source code to get an
                idea of how to accomplish that.

    <title>Transformer</title>
    <para>
        Sometimes it's useful to perform some cmoputations on an NSCLDAQ event
        file and append data to parts of the event.  <application>Transformer</application>
        provides the ability to add an arbitrary extension to fragments of event
        built data. It is a parallel program that runs on top of the
        communication framework we've been describing.
    </para>
    <para>
        The program consists of an input stage, a set of parallel workers that
        can add extension to event fragments, a sorter that resorts the ouptut
        of the workers back into time stamp ordered events.  The pipeline of input
        workers sorting and output are parallel processes as is each worker.
    </para>
    <para>
        Transformer allows you to write the code needed to compute the extension
        for any single event fragment.  This code does not have to be
        MPI or thread-aware though it must be thread-safe.  This code is built
        into a shared library which is loaded by <application>Transformer</application>
        at run time.

        <title>User shared libraries for Transformer</title>
        <para>
            The Transformer uses a set of parallel workers to compute the
            actual extension.  The workers receive blocks of events an
            parcel them off to instances of a <classname>CBuiltRingItemExtender</classname>.
            Each of those instances walks the event fragments in the event
            providing the fragment's ring item to user code embedded in
            a concrete subclass of
            <classname>CBuiltRingItemExtender::CRingItemExtender</classname>.
            The user code must implement the following methods:

                        Since all extension data must remain valid until the
                        entire event has been formatted, you may find that you
                        need to use dynamic memory to hold your extensions.
                        After an event has been formatted and sent to the
                        sorter, this method is called once for each fragment
                        passing in the iovec as <parameter>extension</parameter>
                        that was returned by <methodname>operator()</methodname>.
                        This method is expected to free any dynamic data  that
                        was created to hold that extension data.

            In addition to a concrete extension class, your shared library
            must provide a factory method the Transforme uses to create
            instances of your class.  Each worker gets its own class instance.

        <title>Building the use shared library</title>
        <para>
            This section walks through coding and building the
            <filename>libTestExtender.so</filename> that's included with
            NSCLDAQ as a demonstration.  This code works with Transformer
            to provide a 16 bit checksum bracketed by flag words for each
            fragment in the event.  You can see the sample user code in its
	    entirety at sf.net/projects/nscldaq in the project's source tree
	    in the file
	    <filename>main/utilities/swtrigger/CTestExtender.cpp</filename>.
	    
        </para>

	  Let's start with the class definition:

class CTestExtender : public CBuiltRingItemExtender::CRingItemExtender
{
private:
   struct Extension {
      uint16_t  s_header;

      uint16_t s_trailer;
      
      Extension() {
         s_header = 0xa5a5;
        s_checksum = 0;       <co id='textend.init' />
        s_trailer = 0x5a5a;
      }   
   };

public:

                This struct represents the data we'll be tacking on the end of
                each fragment of the event.  It's once more important to note
                that:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            The program only works on event built data.

                        <para>
                            Our caller will iterate over the fragments in each
                            event and call us once for <emphasis>each</emphasis>
                            fragment in the event.  Of course there's nothing
                            to prevent us from not extending all the fragments.
                            We'll get into how to do that later in the section.
                        </para>

        <callout arearefs='textend.init'>
            <para>
                In C++ structs like classes can have constructors.  This
                constructor just initializes the header and trailer items
                to alternating bit set/clear patterns and the checkusm to zero.
                
            </para>
            <para>
                Doing that here avoids cluttering the actual code that uses
                this extension with initialization code.  It also means
                that in the event we use this struct in more than one location
                we won't be repeating initialization code.
            </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs='textend.functor'>
            <para>
                The function call operator must be implemented by all concrete
                subclasses of <classname>CBuiltRingItemExtender::CRingItemExtender</classname>.
                this method is what will be called to provide an extension.
            </para>
            <para>
                The function call operator must return an <structname>iovec</structname>
                struct.  This structure is defined in the
                <literal>writev(2)</literal> manpage.  Fill in the
                <structfield>iov_len</structfield> field to be the size of
                the extension and the <structfield>iov_base</structfield> pointer
                to point to your extension.  If you are not providing an extension
                for a fragment, set  <structfield>iov_len</structfield> to
                <literal>0</literal>.
            </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs='textend.free'>
            <para>
                The program will collect all extensions and weave them into the
                output event once the event has been fully processed.  Therefore,
                the data passed back must have a lifetime that runs over the
                processing of the entire event, rather than just a single
                fragment.  This means specifically, you
                <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> have a single instance of the
                extension struct which you fill in over and over again for
                each fragment.
            </para>
            <para>
                More usually, you'll dynamically allocate the extensions
                (e.g. with <literal>new</literal>).   Once the event is
                processed, the framework iterates over all extensions it was
                given for that event, calling <methodname>free</methodname>
                passing a reference to an iov that is a copy of the one
                returned from a call to <methodname>operator()</methodname>
                for that fragment.  You should not make any assumptions about
                the order in which the <structname>iovec</structname>
                structs are passed to <methodname>free</methodname>.
            </para>
            <para>
                The expectation is that you will release any dynamic storage
                allocated for the extension provided to you.
            </para>
        </callout>
	</calloutlist>
    <para>
        The implementation section of the code consists of two segments.
        The first segment implements the class methods of
        <classname>CTestExtender</classname>.  Having the class defined
        and implemented is not sufficient, however.  You must also provide
        a mechanism for the framework to create instances of that class.
        To do this you must provide a
        <firstterm>factory function</firstterm> the framework can locate
        after it has loaded your shared library into the program.

                This code computes the checksum into the extension. Recall that
                our constructor initialized that checksum to zero so we can
                directly sum the checksum into that cell.  Note the checksum
                does not include the extension.

                created we've satisfied the lifetime requirement of the extension.

                dynamic storage allocated for a single extension.  The
                extension to destroy is described by the parameter

                        storage.  In that case, however, you'll have to manually
                        initialize the storage as calling a constructor is
                        value that's added by <literal>new/delete</literal>.

        Let's look at the factory function.  It's actually dirt simple but there
        is one subtlety we need to demonstrate.

            <para>
                An important point is that this function is one that the
                framework must be able to locate in the shared object. We
                ensure that in two ways:
            </para>
            <itemizedlist>

                    <para>
                        Using a specific name (<function>createExtender</function>).
                        In other extension architectures (e.g. Tcl), the external
                        entry point is derived from the name of the shared object.
                        In our case, we only have one shared object to load,
                        so a fixed, required name is good enough.

                        the actual function name.  Name mangling decorates
                        the base function name with other information.

                        function is defined and the type of parameter passed to it.

                    <para>
                        This name mangling is compiler dependent and can even by
                        compiler version dependent.  There's no standard for it.
                        Therefore the safest thing to do is to turn it off.
                        The <literal>extern "C" </literal> declaration indicates
                        to the compiler it should use C external bindings for
                        names in the block it covers.  Thus our factory
                        function is not mangled.

                will call it when it needs an instance of our extender class.
                In practice this is once per worker. 
            </para>
            <para>
                In fact when the parallelization strategy is
                <literal>mpi</literal> only worker processes will
                need extension objects and only one per process is needed.
                However if the parallelization strategy is
                <literal>threaded</literal> each worker thread will need
                its own extension object.

        <callout arearefs='text.factory.creation'>
            <para>
                The actual implementation is simple. <literal>new</literal>
                is used to create a new instance of the object and a pointer to
                that object is returned to the caller.  Note that in general,
                the lifetime of the object will be the lifetime of the application.
                It will not be destroyed.
            </para>
            <para>
                In the rare cases your extenders do need to be cleanly destroyed,
                there is a mechanism to do that.  You can have a class
                that contains a vector or list of objects created and whose
                destructor deletes the created objects.  An instance of that
                class can be created statically.  The factory function
                then registers each object it creates prior to returning it.
                At program termination time, the static object's destructor is
                called by the C++ run time and it can run through the registry
                of objects deleteing each of them.
                In most (all?) cases this is <emphasis>not necessary</emphasis>.

        Ok, we have code for our extender.  How do we build it into a shared
        library.    There's no single recipe as the actual compilation and
        link commands will depend on the needs of the library.  There are only
        two requirements:

    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                At compile time, the compiler must generate position independent
                code.  This is because the actual address at which the library
                will be loaded is determined at run time.  To do this use the
                <option>-fPIC</option> option on on the compilation command line.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                At link time, the linker must be told to create a shared object.
                This requires that you supply the <option>-shared</option> on the
                linker command line. You must also use the
                <option>-o</option> flag to specify the name of the shared object.
                If you do not do so, the linker will produce a file named
                <literal>a.out</literal> by default.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
        Note that the compiler and linker are both generally <command>g++</command>
        or, if MPI has been enabled mpicc for OpenMPI and you'll need
        to have set environment variables needed for OpenMPI appropriately.

        <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>
            This program is classifies events for later filtering.
            It operates by sending blocks of data to a set of parallel
            workers.  The workers add an extra
            <type>uint32_t</type> to the event body headers.
            The events are then resorted by timestamp and output to some
            event sink.  
        </para>
        <para>
            The classification is done by loading a shared library provided
            by the user.  the shared library provides a classification class
            and a factory function that creates the instances of that
            class needed by the application.

            This program takes events that have been classified using
            the <application>SoftwareFilter</application> application and
            applies an acceptance criterion.  Events that pass that criterion
            are sent to the accepted output sink.  Optionally events that
            don't pass acceptance are sent to a rejection sink.  
        </para>

            The criterion is specified as a mask of bits that must have a specific value.

        <para>
            The <application>Transfomer</application> program accepts event built
            data as input.  For each fragment in each physics event ring item,
            user written code is invoked to supply an extension data block
            that's put on the back end of each fragment.  The
            sizes are adjusted accordingly so that the resulting ring items
            are fully consistent.
        </para>
        <para>
            The application spins up several parallel workers that process
            blocks of events in parallel.  Resulting ring items are
            re-sorted by timestamp before they are emitted to the output
            sink.

                        to parallelize the processing or physical memroy can
                        be oversubscribed.  Furthermore if the source and
                        destinations are tcp URI's, overly large clump-sizes
                        can mean that the output will lag significantly behind

        <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>
            This program provides the ability to edit the bodies of
            fragments of event built data.  The body of a fragment is,
            in this case, considered to be the body of the ring item
            rather than the  full body which contains the ring item
            header and optional body hedaer.
        </para>
        <para>
            The program recomputes the size of the body and properly
            updates both the ring item header and the fragment header
            size fields prior to outputting the event.
        </para>
        <para>
            The program relies on user code located in a shared library
            whose path is passed to the program at run-time.

            A key data structure that we will be using is a

            of this type are used to describe chunks of the output
            event body.  This structure allows in-place editing with
            minimum data movements.  That is body segments can be
            chunks of the original event as well as new data.

                        be dynamically allocated and this

        </para>
        <para>
            Let's look at the <classname>CBuiltRingItemEditor::BodyEditor</classname>
            class definition and its methods.
        </para>
        <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
class BodyEditor {
public:
    virtual std::vector&lt;BodySegment&gt; operator()(
        pRingItemHeader pHdr, pBodyHeader hdr, size_t bodySize,
        void* pBody
    )  = 0;
    virtual void free(iovec&amp; item) = 0;
};

            </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
            Note that the <type>pRingItemHeader</type> and
            <type>pBodyHeader</type> types are defined
            in <filename>DataFormat.h</filename> and described in the
            reference section <literal>3daq</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            <methodname>operator()</methodname> is called for each
            fragment of each event.  <parameter>pHdr</parameter>
            points to the ring item header of that fragment
            (fragments are assumed to be ring items).
            <parameter>hdr</parameter> points to the body header
            of the event.  This program requires that event fragments
            have body headers (as pretty much all do now).
            Finally <parameter>bodySize</parameter> are the
            number of bytes in the body of the fragment ring item
            and <parameter>pBody</parameter> points to that body
        </para>
        <para>
            <methodname>operator()</methodname> returns a vector of
            body segment descriptors that describe what the new
            body will look like.  The method normally should not
            modify the ring item and body headers.   The caller
            will perform any modifications needed for the new
            size of the body.  Here's an example of code that
            returns the original body un-modified:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
...
{
    std::vector&lt;BodySegment&gt; result;
    BodySegment body(bodySize, pBody);
    result.push_back(body);
    return result;
    
}
            </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
            This is a valid though uninteresting example.
        </para>
        <para>
            When producing data to go in the body, that data must
            typically be dynamically allocated.  This is because the
            entire clump of ring items, and fragments in each event ring
            item are processed before passing the resulting data to
            the sorting thread/process.  Here's sample code to
            insert a uint32_t <literal>0xa5a5a5a5</literal> at the
            beginning of the fragment and a <literal>0x5a5a5a5a</literal>
            after the existing body:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
{
    std::vector&lt;BodySegment&gt; result;
    uint32_t* pHeader = new uint32_t(0xa5a5a5a5);
    uint32_t* pTrailer= new uint32_t(0x5a5a5a5a);
    BodySegment descHeader(sizeof(uint32_t), pHeader, true);
    BodySegment body(bodySize, pBody);
    BodySegment descTrailer(sizeof(uint32_t), pTrailer, true);
    
    result.push_back(descHeader);
    result.push_back(body);
    result.push_back(descTrailer);
    return result;
}
            </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
            The key point to get here is that it's not necessary to
            open up space for the header by sliding the original data
            down or any other data movement.  Just create the data for
            the header, and trailer and provide descriptors.
            Note that the <structfield>is_isDynamic</structfield> field
            for those items is true.
        </para>
        <para>
            After events have been emitted, the event editor
            goes through the set of descriptors for that event and
            invokes <methodname>free</methodname> for each dynamically
            allocated segment.  This method is passed the
            <structfield>s_description</structfield> field of that description.
            That method should dispose of the dynamic storage associated with
            that descriptor.  For our previous example:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
{
    uint32_t* pInt = static_cast&lt;uint32_t*&gt;(item.iov_base);
    delete pInt;
}
            </programlisting>

                    <classname>CBuiltRingItemEitor::BodyEditor</classname>
                    and promises to supply implementation of its base class's

                    This declares our method's result.  A vector of
                    body segment descriptors.  In our case we'll need three of
                    them.  One for our header word, one for the original body
                    and one for the trailer word.

                    <methodname>free</methodname> is called for them).  Therefore
                    even though they are simple uin32_t objects they must be

                    This section of code builds the three descriptors we need.

                    The descriptors are pushed into the return vector in the
                    order in which we want to see them in the final, edited,
                    event.  The resulting vector is returned as the

                    Our implementation of <methodname>free</methodname>
                    is invoked for each header and trailer.  We cast the pointer
                    to the data to a uint32_t pointer and delete.
                    Note that if you might have had several types of data
                    you're adding to the event, you may need to use
                    <structfield>iov_len</structfield> to untangle which to
                    delete - or better yet, make them all derive from a common
                    base class with virtual destructors.  You can then cast
                    to that base class and delete.

                    The factory function <function>createEditor</function>

        <para>
            The <application>FullEventEditor</application> program depends on
            application specific user code to actually edit the event.  This code
            can modify all data following the size field of the event.   The
            size field, while accessible, will be automatically updated by
            <application>FullEventEditor</application> to reflect the size of the
            modified event body. Furthermore, the size field of the event's ring
            item header will be updated as well to reflect the updated event size.
            Note, however that it is the responsibility of the user editing
            code to update any size fields at the fragment level.  These are at
            least:

            Note that the bodies of fragments may also have sizes that require

            The user event editing code is supplied to the

            entry point named: <function>createFullEventEditor</function>.
            That entry is a function that takes no parameters and returns a new

            It is important that each call to

            that participates in parallel sequential processing.  The idea

        <para>
            Processing elements contain flow of control that typically
            accepts data, processes it and then sends resulting data to
            a subsequent stage of the data processing pipeline.
            Concrete <classname>CProcessingElements</classname> often
            construct with parameters that include a
            <classname>CReceiver</classname> to receive the data,
            a <classname>CSender</classname> to send processed data and a
            <classname>CProcessor</classname> to do the actual processing.
        </para>
        <para>
            In the prototoypical processing element, the
            <methodname>operator()</methodname> method will use the objects'
            <classname>CReceiver</classname> to obtain work elements.
            <methodname>process</methodname> would then be called which
            would, in turn, call the <methodname>process</methodname>
            method of an encapsulated <classname>CProcessor</classname>
            object.
        </para>
        <para>
            <methodname>operator()</methodname> would also be responsible
            for knowing when the last work item has been received and
            shutting down the object after that has been processed.
            In a typical, application, an empty data item might be a flag
            that there are no more data items and the processor's
            <methodname>process</methodname> would, in turn, be
            responsible for notifying subsequent stages of the computation,
            if appropriate.

        <para>
            In most parallel computations there are segments of the computation
            in which work items fan out to worker processes that operate
            on work items independently and in full parallel with all other
            workers.
        </para>
        <para>
            The NSCLDAQ parallel computing framework provides for transports
            that do that fanout and transports that are clients of those
            fanouts.   This class is a base class that encapsulates a
            receiver that is a fanout client, an arbitrary sender and a
            main control flow that accepts data and asks the unimplemented
            <methodname>process</methodname> method to process it.  Processing
            continues until an empty (zero sized) work item is received.
        </para>
        <para>
            The sender is exposed to subclasses so that it is available
            in <methodname>process</methodname> as implemented by
            concrete classes.  The sender receives the zero length
            work item and is expected to do any shutdown required of the sender.

            Transports are objects that carry data across some high level
            protocol for data transport.  Examples of high level protocols
            are ZeroMQ (ZMQ), MPI, or event raw TCP/IP sockets.
            Transports are normally bound into a
            <classname>CSender</classname> or <classname>CReceiver</classname>
            object.
        </para>
        <para>
            Transport insulate the actual mechanisms of data transport from
            those objects.  Each concrete transport must, at a minimum
            implement the <methodname>recv</methodname> and
            <methodname>send</methodname> methods.  In addition,
            transports may implement the <methodname>end</methodname> method
            which is used to signal for a transport used inside a
            <classname>CSender</classname> that no more data will be transferred
            on that transport.

                        in many transports, a size of 0 is used to indicate end

                        and should not be freed.

            a mechanism to send data to the transports peer using
            some communication pattern. Note that as far
            as the application code is concerned, this is a
            unidirectional data path.  The underlying
            transport or communication pattern may bi-directional
            message exchanges to accomplish a data transfer,
            but that's hidden from the user code.

                        When designing mechanisms to implement
                        communication patterns (e.g. fanout),
                        it's recommended that all high level
                        protocol code be implemented in the
                        transport so that the simple code of this
                        class can be used everywhere..

            This class provides a transport that can be used
            for unit testing.  Data that have been sent are retained
            for examination.  Data can be put into the object
            for later receipt via <methodname>recv</methodname>
            calls.   In this way a known load of inbound message
            can be injected into users of the transport and
            messages resulting from processing can be
            pulled out to ensure they are as expected.

        <para>
            Some transports need to be able to identify clients.
            For example, a fanout transport  must, when there's no
            data remaining, send an end to all remaining
            clients.  The <classname>CClientRegistry</classname>
            allows each client to have a unique <type>uint64_t</type>
            identifier.  
        </para>
        <para>
            It provides the facility to add and remove clients,
            to test for the presence of clients and to
            test for an empty client registry.
        </para>
        <para>
            The class prevents client duplication and
            removal of nonexistent clients by throwing
            <classname>std::logic_error</classname>
            exceptions.

            This abstract base class is intended to be one of
            many targets for messages sent by
            a <classname>CFanoutTransport</classname> objects.
            It is a transport that provides the
            <methodname>setId</methodname> method which is
            supposed to establish the client id of the
            transport.  Client ids are assumed to be unique
            across all of the clients of a single fanout
            transport.  Note that data should not be received
            prior to setting the id.

            Note that there is a constructor for writing and a different
            one for reading. This represents the fundamental
            difference between producers and consumers of ring
            data.  Attempting to receive data from
            a ring transport that's been set up to as a producer
            or attempting to send data to a ring buffer
            that's been setup as a consumer results in a
            <classname>std::logic_error</classname> exception.

            These two classes encapsulate ZeroMQ sockets.
            <classname>CZMQTransport</classname>  is intended
            to be used as a base class for more interesting
            transports using ZeroMQ.

            This class is not useful in and of itself.
            The intent is that it be a base class and the
            resulting concrete class sets up the
            appropriate <classname>zmq::socket_t</classname>
            and wraps it using the
            <methodname>setSocket</methodname> method

        <para>
            This class implements a fanout transport using
            the ZeroMQ ROUTER/DEALER communication pattern
            (see <classname>CZMQDealerTransport</classname>)(3daq).
            ZMQ routera use a pull protocol in which each
            worker sends a request for data which is honored
            by the DEALER.
        </para>
        <para>
            The protocol of getting pull requests and then
            providing them is totally transparent to the users
            of this class.  Each call to send sends the data
            as a work item to some worker process
            running the DEALER protocol.
        </para>
        <para>
            Since pull requests require the DEALER to have set up
            an id, the pull requests build up a picture of the
            client ids.  This picture is used by
            <methodname>end</methodname> to ensure that all
            clients see an end condition.

        <para>
            The ZMQ Router/Dealer communication pattern provides
            mechanism to fan work units out to parallel workers.
            The Router, whose transport is
            <classname>CZMQRouterTransport</classname>(3daq)
            is the fanout.  The workers receive data via this
            class.
        </para>
        <para>
            The transports hide the details of requesting data
            and stripping delimeters.  From the users's point of
            view the worker just does a call to
            <methodname>recv</methodname> and a work unit is
            returned.

        <para>
            This class is intended to be used at the end
            of the processing pipeline.  It simply accepts
            work items and sends them to a sink.  A usual
            application transforms a set of input work items
            into an output set via a parallel application.
        </para>
        <para>
            While the last stage of that computation could output
            those data, it would then be more work to
            insert additional processing layers in the application
            as it's incrementally built and tested.
            Having a dedicated processing element to output
            data allows for that code to live on its own
            where additional processing stages could be inserted
            prior to it.

            which will distribute it to the workers.

            When an end is detected on the input stream,

            which ensures that all workers get an end condition.

        <para>
            One of the main purposes of the parallel processing
            framework is to set up software triggers. In NSCLDAQ
            these operate in two stages.  The first stage
            classifies ring items with a uint32_t value.
            The second stage retains or discards items by
            applying an acceptance criterion to this classification.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that only <literal>PHYSICS_EVENT</literal> items
            get classified.  The classification is carried with
            the ring item as an extension to that item's body
            header.  This class provides a framework that
            allows the user to simply report back the classification.
            All the work of getting work items, formatting the
            output ring items and sending them on to the next
            stage of processing are taken care of by this class.
        </para>
        <para>
            The data processed by this class are assumed to have come
            from a <classname>CRingItemZMQDataSource</classname>
            or any other data source that produces the
            same output format.  The data source is
            assumed to be a fanout data source as classification
            may be computationally intensive enough to
            be worth parallelization.

            In shared memory multiprocessing parallelism,
            it's often simplest to run each parallel processing
            element in a thread of its own.  Each thread then
            gets scheduled to available cores in the system
            by the underlying scheduler.  This class
            leverages the <classname>Thread</classname>(3daq)
            class in NSCLDAQ to embed a

            When the application initialization code runs a threaded

            then constructs a <classname>CThreadedProcessingElement</classname>
            for each processor.  Processors are then started
            using the <classname>Thread</classname> class's
            <methodname>start</methodname> method. 
            When the thread begins execution it will call

            Pure abstract transport factory.   Parallel programs
            can feature a variety of communication patterns.
            This factory is an abstract base class for factories
            that know how to create transport objects for
            several common communication factories.
        </para>
        <para>
            The idea is that application initialization
            code would use an appropriate factory to
            create the transports it needs.  Use of factories
            would make changing the communications methods as
            easy as changing the factory used to create
            the transports.
        </para>
        <para>
            As different communication schemes will have differing
            ways to specify communication endpoints.  specifications
            are reduced to integers in this scheme.
            A concrete factory will, in general, need a
            mechanism to convert these integers into native
            endp;oint specifications.
            How this is done is factory specific.

        <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>
            This is a factory specialized for the ZeroMQ
            communications system.  See
            <classname>CCommunicatorFactory</classname>
            for more information.  This manpage will only
            describe the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) specific information
            about this factory.
        </para>
        <para>
            Native ZMQ specifies endpoints as URI's  The URI's
            describe the communcations mechanism using the
            URI protocol to specify its own transport mechanism
            (e.g. tcp or inproc etc.) and the remainder of the
            URI to specify transport specific information.
            For example, <literal>tcp://somehost.net:1234</literal>
            specifies a TCP/IP port on smoehost.net port number
            1234.  <literal>inproc://myendpoint</literal> specifies
            a process internal communication transport named
            <literal>myendpoint</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            This rich space of URIs must, in some way be mapped
            to factory endpoint ids, which are integer (and back
            for that matter).  The ZMQ factory does this by
            allowing the user to specify end point mapping files.
            Three endpoint mapping files can be specified and
            <emphasis>all</emphasis> are read allowing endpoints
            to be user specific, project specific and run specific.
            The end point files are:

            To support special needs, the factory adds the
            method <methodname>getUri</methodname>.  This method
            takes an integer endpoint id as a parameter and
            returns an <type>std::string</type> containing the
            Uri that corresponds to that end point.

            (including calls to <methodname>getUri</methodname>)

            Endpoint files are used to create a correspondence between
            integer endpointId values and ZMQ endpoint Uris.
            These files are textual.  Leading and trailing
            whitespace characters
            on each line are ignored.
            Empty lines are ignored.  Lines whose first
            non-whitespace character is <literal>#</literal> are
            ignored as well.
        </para>
        <para>
            All of these make it possible for you to create
            readable and well commented endpoint files.
        </para>
        <para>
            Each line that is not ignored must have two fields.
            The first field is an integer endpoint id.
            The second field is a string that specifies
            the URI that endpoint Id corresponds to.

        <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
        <para>
            This is the base class for transports that use the Message Passing
            Interface (MPI) for communication.  Note that MPI applications
            normally require a helper program (e.g. <command>mpirun</command>)
            to be started.
        </para>
        <para>
            MPI application endpoints are ranks.  By default these are ranks
            within the communicator named <literal>MPI_COMM_WORLD</literal>.
            It is possible, however, for applications to build groups of processes
            that perform communication using sub-set communicators.  Doing that
            is beyond the scope fo this library, however there is support for
            using such communicators.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that in addition to being able to target specific
            receivers with messages, each message has a tag
            associated with it.  The framework uses those tags
            as follows:

        <para>
            This transport provides the supplier side of mechanism to fanout
            data chunks to multiple workers.  Fanouts allow for worker
            processes to operate in parallel on distinct chunks of data.
            Clients of this data accept it using a
            <classname>CMPIFanoutClientTransport</classname> class.
        </para>
        <para>
            At a low level, the protocol used is a pull protocol. When a worker
            is ready for data, it requests it by sending this rank an empty
            message with a <literal>dataRequestTag</literal> (value is
            <literal>2</literal>).  <methodname>send</methodname> operations
            read the next data request message and respond by sending the
            requested data to the rank that sent the data request.
        </para>
        <para>
            As each process sends a data request, it is rememebered and end
            of data is handled by sending end of datas as requested until all
            registered requestors have received the end..

                        or is not tagged by a <literal>dataRequestTag</literal>,

        <para>
            Objects of this class should be used to get data from
            a fanout tranposrt (MPI).  Note that for MPI transports, the
            ID of the client is always its rank in the communicator.  This implies
            that the communicator used by the fanout and its client must be the
            same.  This also implies that the
            <methodname>setId</methodname> method, in fact, actually does nothing.

            This class fans out data from ring buffer structured files or
            live ring buffers.  To use this, construct it and then call
            the base class's <methodname>operator()</methodname> functor
            method.  The object then reads data from the ring item data
            source and fans it out to its clients until there's no more
            data (never for a live ring, end of file for a file).
        </para>
        <para>
            The constructor parameter <parameter>ringUri</parameter>
            identifiles the data source and can be either a file
            (<literal>file:</literal> protocol URI) or a live ring
            (<literal>tcp:</literal> protocol URI).

            The <parameter>chunkSize</parameter> parameter allows you to tune
            the performance efficiency of the transport.  Each message will
            <parameter>cunkSize</parameter> complete ring items unless an
            end file is hit prior to filfilling this obligations.
