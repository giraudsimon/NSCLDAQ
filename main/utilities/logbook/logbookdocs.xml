      <para>
         In this section we're going to describe what the logbook facility is
         it components and how they all fit together.   
      </para>
      <para>
         First, what is a logbook and what does it hold?  Put simply, a logbook
         is an sqlite3 database file.  Sqlite3 is a file based SQL compliant
         database which provides ACID access without the need for administrative
         actions to create and serve out the database.  Sqlite3
         is described in the web pages in
         <ulink url='https://www.sqlite.org' />.
      </para>
      <para>
         At the physical level, a logbook is, therefore, just a single file
         that contains an Sqlite3 database. The database schema (tables
         and relations between those tables), provide the database with the
         ability to store:

            <listitem>
                <para>
                  People, are collaborators that work on the experiment.
                  People may run shifts, participate in the analysis or have
                  other roles in the experiment.  The reason people are
                  named and stored in the database is to allow operations
                  and artefacts stored in the logbook to be attributed to them
                  either as individuals or groups of individuals.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                  A shift is a named container for people.  Shifts are intended to
                  capture how experiments are run during data taking.
                  Run state changes in the experiment, which can be automatically
                  logged, are attributed to the shift that's on-duty at the time
                  the transition occurs.  
               </para>
               <para>
                  Shifts should be setup at the beginning of an experiment, but
                  once an experiment starts taking data they should be thought of
                  as read-only.  If necessary, you can create additional shifts.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                  A run is a segment of data taking.  Runs have numbers and
                  titles and state transitions (e.g.they begin and they end).
                  The logbook facility has the ability to automatically create
                  runs and log their state transitions.
               </para>
                <para>
                  Run state transitions are logged as having occured during a
                  shift and the shift is stored along with the transition.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                  Notes are rich text artifacts that you can enter into the system.
                  In a paper logbook what we call notes are by fare the most
                  common entry.  Notes can be associated with a run or
                  be independent of a run.  Notes have a single author.
               </para>
                <para>
                  Notes are rich text in the sense that they can include
                  figures/graphics that will be stored in the database and associated
                  with their note.  When a note is rendered for view, graphics
                  are rendered inline where they were included.  The
                  contents of the actual files
                  containing the graphics are loaded into the database making
                  the database file all inclusive.
                </para>
                <para>
                  Notes are written using Markdown for formatting.
                  See <ulink url='http://markdownguide.org' /> for more information
                  about markdown.

                  Key value pairs are just a key that points to a textual value.
                  One use of them is to document the experiment the database
                  is a logbook of.

         So now we know what a logbook is and what it can contain, let's look at
         the components of the system.  Logbook system is built in a layered fashion.
         The rough layering is shown in the line drawing below.

      <para>
         Note that NSCLDAQ expects an installation of <filename>libsqlite3</filename>
         and its development files to be present.   All other software
         in the figure above are built and distributed into NSCLDAQ.

      <para>
         In most cases you will only need to interact with the top level of this
         layer diagram.  If you wish to extend access to the database or provide
         other mechanisms for data entry, you can do that at any of the layers
         shown down to and inluding the raw Sqlite API.  We recommend, however
         you program the data base at the highest level of the diagram that provides
         you with capabilities you need.
      </para>
      <para>
         In addition to the software shown above, and the database file, a
         hidden directory <filename>~/.nscl-logbook</filename> is used
         by the system to pull image files from the database as needed and to
         generate HTML files used for online browsing of the logbook.  The
         contents of this directory can be  cleaned up without affecting proper
         operation of the logbook.  Finally the high level software has the concept
         of a currently selected logbook.  The path to this logbook file is stored
         in
         <filename>~/.nscl-logbook-current</filename>.  If you remove this file,
         You'll need to select the logbook you're operating on using e.g. the
         <filename>$DAQBIN/lg_current</filename> command utility.
      </para>
      <para>
         The ReadoutGUI bundle is a callback bundle for the ReadoutGUI.  When
          it is incorporated into the user's <filename>ReadoutCallouts.tcl</filename>
          file, run transitions will be automatically logged into the currently
          selected database.

         Several command utilities are provided.  Reference material for these
         are provided in the <literal>1daq</literal> man pages.  Here we
         just gloss over their names what they are and what they do.  All
         command utilities get installed in $DAQBIN and have names starting

                  the filename of the new logbook must be supplied and information
                  about the experiment.  The new logbook can optionally be made
                  current.

                  Creates new shifts.  A shift is a collection of people that

                  can create as many shifts as you want and compose them any way
                  you want.  The people that are in shifts must have previously

                <para>
                  Note that shifts should be set up prior to starting to run the
                  experiment.  Once a named shift has been on duty and started/stopped
                  runs, it must not be modified.  This is because run transition
                  records in the logbook
                  don't carry along with them references to the people on shift,
                  but references to the on-duty shift.
                </para>
                <para>
                  Thus if a shift is edited mid-experiment, the documentation
                  of the on-duty shift associated with a run state transition will
                  be correct but the members of that shift will reflect the most
                  recent editing of the shift.  This can attribute a transition
                  to the wrong set of people, and that's not desirable.

            The <command>lg_create</command> command (in <filename>$DAQBIN</filename>),
            allows you to create a new logbook and optionally make it current.
            When you create a logbook you must not only provide the filename
            into which the logbook will be stored, but information about
            what they logbook is for that will be stored in the key value store
            of the logbook.  Specifically  you need to provide:

         <para>  
            It seems obvious to say so but experiments are run by people. During
            data taking, those people are organized into shifts.  When runs
            undergo state transitions (start, stop, pause, resume), it's important,
            not only, to log that this happened, but which shift was on duty
            at the time.

         </itemizedlist>
         <para>
            Shifts should be static once data taking has started.  This is because
            it is a shift that's associated with a run state transition, not the
            current members of that shift.   Consider the following case as an example.
         </para>
         <para>
            Suppose I have an experiment with three members, A, B, C. Suppose,
            I make a shift called S which and add members A and B to it, and make
            that the current shift.  Now I start a run.  That's associated with
            shift S. I end the run.  If I then edit shift S to remove person B
            and add person C, the run I just take, is still associated with
            shift S and therefore thinks data taking was during a shift that
            involved person A and C rather than person A, and B -- because shift
            S was edited out from underneath that run.
         </para>
         <para>
            You can make new shifts at any time.  If shift membership changes
            during the run, just make a new shift and and add the proper members
            to it.

               It's quite normal to leave the selector up throughout data taking
               so that shift changes can be easily made without needing to invoke

      <para>
         Before you start data taking, you should add the logbook subsystem
         to the readout GUI.  This is done by adding the following line to your
         <filename>ReadoutCallouts.tcl</filename> file:
      </para>
      <example>
         <title>Enabling automatic recording of run state transitions</title>
         <programlisting>
package require logbookbundle
         </programlisting>
      </example>
      <para>
         Simple as that.   Since the logbook subsystem makes use of the callback
         bundle facility of the readout GUI, you don't need to add any code
         to any of your <literal>Onxxx</literal> procs.
      </para>
      <para>
         For all runs with recording enabled, the logbook will log all state
         transitions associated with a data taking run.  These include Begin runs,
         End Runs, Pause runs and Resume runs.  Furthermore, when the ReadoutGUI
         starts and the <literal>logbookbundle</literal> is pulled in, the bundle
         checks for a run in progress (from the database point of view).  This can
         happen if the previous run was improperly ended and the ReadoutGUI needed
         to be restarted.  
      </para>
      <para>
         If there is a currently active run, the logbook will log an
         <literal>EMERGENCY_END</literal> state transition for that active run.
         This makes the run inactive and creates a log entry that lets you know,
         when you review that run later on, it was improperly ended.
      </para>
      <para>
         Since the logbook bundle will immediately access the database,
         and since it may also need to log a state transition, prior to starting
         the ReadoutGUi you must:
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>

            If all the logbook could do is manage shifts and log run state transitions

            <para>
               A note is a formatted chunk of text.  My formatted I mean that
               it can have titles, subtitles, bulleted lists, numbered lists,
               code samples, referencdes to the web and inline images.  We'll cover

            <para>
               All notes are written by someone.  That is, they are associated
               with one, and exactly one person that is known to the logbook.
            </para>
            <para>
               Notes <emphasis>may</emphasis>, or may not be, associated with
               a run.  When choosing if a note should be associated with a run,
               think about wether the content of the note has to do with the
               run or is a more general statement that spans the course of
               more than one run.
            </para>
            <para>
               Notes also have a timestamp associated with them that logs when
               they were created. 
            </para>
            <para>
               While author selection and run association are done manually
               by the person editing and saving the note, the timestamp is generated
               automatically when the note is saved.
            </para>
            <para>
               As with most entities in the logbook (other than shift membership),
               notes are write-once, read-many. As with a paper lab notebook, you're not
               allowed to modify or delete a note once it's been written.

               Notes are created using the note editor.  This can be brought up
               either inside the browser (see
               <link linkend='sec.lg_browsing' endterm='sec.lg_browsing.title' />),

               The note editor provides a mechanism to set, or for that matter,
               remove association with a run.

               Current author and run association is shown at the top of the
               window.  Author association is a pulldown menu activated by the
               down arrow to the right of it.  Select your name as it's know to the
               database from the list of authors.  Initially no author is shown
               as associated with the note.  If you try to save the note without
               selecting an author an error will be thrown.
            </para>
            <para>
               To the right of the author assocationis the run assocation. In the
               figure, the note we are composing will be associated with run 5.
               To change the run assocation, select a run from the list in the list
               box at the left of the editor window.  For convenience, the first
               few characters of the title are provided to the right of the
               run number.  Simply double click the run the note is to be associated
               with to change the associated run.  If you don't wann a run associated
               with this note, just double click the empty line at the top of the
               listbox.

               The largest area of the  editor is the big frame at the right. Edit
               the text of your note in this area.  We'll talk a bit more about

               Image references can be manually inserted but, not only is the
               markdown for that a bit tricky to remember, but you may want
               to browse for the image file to insert.  If you right click in the

               command will bring up a dialog that allows you to specify the image file
               (must be an image file or rendering of the note will fail), and a

               This section is a non-exhaustive primer on markdown format.
               Markdown is a simple, plain text, formatting system. It allows you
               to easily create rich content. Markdown is used in many wikis,
               as well as in gitlab and github to support formatted text.

                     I strongly suggest letting the note editor produce these for you,
                     but for completeness, an image link  has the form:
                     <literal>![some text](image-file)</literal>
                     The use of the stuff in <literal>[]</literal> depends on the
                     output format.  For web this is used as what is called
                     <firstterm>alt text</firstterm>, that is text that is shown
                     in browsers that are not capable of displaying images.
                     Do not count on this text being displayed.

                     The simplest format for a table in markdown uses pipes.
                     For example, this markdown:
                   </para>
                   <literallayout>
You should put a blank line fore:

| Animal | Species |
| -------|---------|
| Wolf   | canis lupus |
| Cat    | felis domesticus |
| Golden Hamster | mesocricetus auratus |

and aft.

                   </literallayout>
                   <para>
                     Note that the table doesn't have to line up nicely. The
                     markdown above generates something like:
                   </para>
                   <informaltable>
                     <tgroup cols='2'>

                     number (e.g. <literal>[^1]</literal> for footnote).
                     The footnote text itself (for footnote 1 e.g.) is

                     In the web, the footnote text will, most likely, render in position

               Markdown can do much much more.  I encourage you to play with a toy
               logbook and browse through
               <ulink url='https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/' />
               for basic syntax supported by all markdown processors and
               <ulink url='https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/' />
               for syntax most markdown processors support.   I have not exhaustively
               checked which bits of extended markdown are supported by the Tcl
               <literal>Markdown</literal> package and <literal>pandoc</literal>.
               Play around and see what you get.

            <para>
               Let's look at the contents of the <literal>People</literal> tab:

            <para>
               As you can see, this tab provides a list of the people that have
               been added to the logbook.  If you right click anywhere in the
               list, you'll bring up a context men. Clicking
               <guimenuitem>Add...</guimenuitem> on this menu will allow you
               to specify the first name, last name, and optional salutation

            <title>Shifts Tab</title>
            <para>
               Let's have a look at the shift tab of the browser:
            </para>
            <figure>
                <title><command>lg_browse</command> <literal>Shifts</literal> tab</title>

            </figure>
            <para>
               As you can see the shifts are listed.  Clicking on a shift opens it
               up (as has been done for the <literal>day</literal> shift) to
               list the members of that shift.  If there's a current shift,
               the word <literal>(current)</literal> is shown by its name.
            </para>
            <para>
               If a shift or one of its members has been selected, right clicking
               brings up a context menu with the following commands:
            </para>
            <variablelist>
               <varlistentry>

                   <para>
                     Brings up the shift editor so that you can add a new shift
                     and populate it with members.
                   </para>

            <title>LogBook Tab</title>
            <para>
               During and after a run, you will probably spend most of your time
               on the <literal>LogBook</literal> tab. This tab allows
               you to access all of the runs that have been recorded and notes that
               have been written.  The figure below shows this tab with some of
               the items expanded:
            </para>
            <figure>

                <graphic fileref='lg_logbooktab.jpg' />
            </figure>
            <para>
               First note that this tab, as with all tabs in the browser periodically
               updates its contents.  This is done in such a way as to preserve
               the open items.  Thus changes performed by other programs and other
               people are reflected dynamically by the browser.
            </para>
            <para>
               At the top of the list of items in this tab, is an entry
               labeled <literal>None</literal>.  If this is expanded you will
               see a list of the notes that were created that were not associated
               with any run.
            </para>
            <para>
               Below that, each numbered entry is a run.  The title for the run
               is shown on that line as well as the state of that run.  In this
               example, there are no active runs.  Expanding a run lists all of
               its transitions, when they occured and the remarks associated with
               each transition (in this case that they were automatically logged),
               and name of the active shift when the transition occured. Finally the
               transition time is aslo shown
            </para>
            <para>
               Each transition can be further expanded.  When that's done the
               list of people on that shift are listed.
            </para>
            <para>
               Entries are also shown for each note associated with the run.
               In this case the notes were added after the run ended (perfectly legal),
               The notes, however are normaly interleaved with the transitions so
               that everything that was done with a run is listed in
               chronological order.
            </para>
            <para>
               At any time a single item can be selected.  right clicking brings
               up a context menu with the following actions:
            </para>
            <variablelist>
               <varlistentry>

                  <para>
                     Allows you to compose a new note.  If the selected item
                     is in a run (vs. in the <literal>None</literal>) item,
                     the initially selected associated run in the note editor
                     will be that run.  If you want to associate the note to
                     a different run or write a new note not associated with any
                     run, naturally, you can change this association in note
                     editor.

                     The logbook will be rendered in the following order:
                     First the runs and their contents (transitions and notes)
                     will be rendered.  Finally, the notes not associated with

         <title>Obtaining a suitable NSCL-linux container</title>
         <para>
            First a bit about what a container image is and what singularity is.
         </para>
         <para>
            Container technology provides a light-weight scheme for executing
            user land software for one distribution of linux on the run-time
            environment of another distribution.  For example, At the NSCL,
            we use and have established reasonable methods for installing our software
            on Debian systems.  Your institution may run a Red Hat Enterprise
            Linux base distribution such as CentOS.  The names and availablility
            of packages needed to support NSCLDAQ may differ.
         </para>
         <para>
            Rather than trying to figure out how to install NSCLDAQ on all Linux
            distributions, wouldn't it be nice if you could run a simple program
            and your filesystem containing the Linux userland programs and libraries
            would be Debian?  This is what singularity container images provide.
         </para>
         <para>
            A singularity container image can be thought of as a part of a filesystem
            that gets overlaid on top of the running Linux system filesystem
            while you are running that container.  This allows us to provide
            you with a Debian environment that you can run on your e.g. CentOS
            environment.  Because singularity containers only play games with what
            the filesystem look like, the overhead for running a container is
            essentially nonexistent once a program starts.
         </para>
         <para>
            What you <emphasis>will</emphasis> need, however is the singularity
            container run-time environment.  For Debian like systems (e.g.
            Ubuntu, Kubuntu etc.), this is provided by the <literal>singularity-container</literal>
            package.  For RHEL based systems <command>yum</command> can be used
            to install the <literal>singularity</literal> package.  For
            general installation instructions that can be used to guide you through
            other linux distributions, see the singularity Admin guide for the
            appropriate version of singularity at
            <ulink url='https://sylabs.io/docs/' />.
         </para>
         <para>
            In order to keep our singularity image small, and to avoid re-making
            it for each NSCLDAQ or SpecTcl update (you can use Singularity to also
            install SpecTcl), our images only contain the linux packages needed
            to support our software and we use filesystem binding to keep
            our container images separate from the actual software installation
            trees.  This is why you need to get both an image and a corresponding
            binary installation tree.
         </para>
         <para>
            Our images are installed at the NSCL in <filename>/usr/opt</filename>
            with names like <filename>nscl-<replaceable>code-word</replaceable>.img</filename>
            where <replaceable>code-word</replaceable> is the linux distribution
            code-word.  For example, as I'm writing this, we have two images:
            <filename>/usr/opt/nscl-jessie.img</filename> which provides
            a Debian-8 (jessie) environment and
            <filename>/usr/opt/nscl-buster.img</filename> which  provides
            a Debian-10 (buster) environment.
         </para>
         <para>
            At NSCL/FRIB your experiment will, in general run in a container.
            For simplicity, choose the container you used for your experiment,
            and copy it to your institution.  While 'large', the images are not
            enormous clocking in at about 2GB for the buster image.

         <title>Getting the NSCLDAQ binary distribution</title>
         <para>
            The simplest way to get this is to run the container you used
            for your experiment in the same way you ran it during the experiment.
            When you do, the evironment variable <literal>DAQROOT</literal>
            will point to the installation tree you'll need to grab.
         </para>
         <para>
            The following creates a <firstterm>tarball</firstterm> of that
            directory tree in your home directory:

         <informalexample>

         <para>
            Pull the resulting tarball, <filename>~/nscldaq-install.tar.gz</filename>
            over to your home institution.  The resulting tarball should be
            smaller than 200Mbytes.  Also make note of the value of the
            <literal>DAQROOT</literal>
            environment variable.  You'll need it later.  
         </para>
      </section>
      <section>
         <title>Installing your container and NSCLDAQ tree.</title>
         <para>
            So you've got a container and a tarball of an NSCLDAQ installation
            tree.  You need to put the container image somewhere and
            unroll the <filename>nscldaq-install.tar.gz</filename> tarball
            somewhere where it's easy to coerce singularity to map that directory
            tree back to its original position in the directory tree.
         </para>
         <para>
            To do this, I'm going to assume you have some directory somewhere
            for simplicity, we'll call it <filename>/nscldaqinstall</filename>
            modify these instructions to match where you actually put this stuff.
            Note that centralizing this installation will allow anybody with read
            access to the container and the NSCLDAQ directory tree to use
            its software.
         </para>
         <para>
            first put your container (for simplicity I'm going to assume you
            grabbed <filename>nscl-buster.img</filename>) in
            <filename>/nscldaqinstall/nscl-buster.img</filename>.
         </para>
         <para>
            Next unwrap the tarball as follows (I'm going to assume DAQROOT claimed)
            it was <filename>/usr/opt/nscldaq/12.0-000</filename>), and that the
            tarball is now sitting in your home directory.
         </para>
         <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
mkdir /nscldaqinstall/opt-buster       # in case later you get a second container.
mkdir -p /nscldaqinstall/opt-buster/nscldaq/12.0-000  # We'll put tuff here.
(cd /nscldaqinstall/opt-buster; ln nscldaq daq);   # NSCL has this convenience link.
(cd /nscldaqinstall/opt-buster/nscldaq/12.0-000; tar xzf ~/nscldaq-install.tar.gz)

            </programlisting>
         </informalexample>
         <para>
            Ok, let's review what we've done and why. First we installed
            our container where we can get it.  Second we produced a directory tree
            that can be mapped on to /usr/opt in the container that mimics what
            NSCL does and put the contents of our tarball in the correct part of
            that directory tree.  If we wanted to haul SpecTcl 5.3-010 over, for example,
            we'd just need to add <filename>/nscldaq/opt-buster/spectcl/5.3-010</filename>
            grab a tarball as we did for NSCLDQAQ and unwrap it there.  Similarly
            if we need additional versions of NSCLDAQ or spectcl we can grab
            additional tarballs and drop them in appropriate parts of the
            <filename>/nscldaqinstall/opt-buster</filename> directory tree.
            We could even grab the installation of root in /usr/opt from NSCL
            and drop that in (we'd need that for SpecTcl and we might just want
            it in the container after all).
         </para>
      </section>
      <section>
         <title>Running the singularity container</title>
         <para>
            Now we're ready to get going. We're going to use the
            <command>singularity</command> command to overlay the
            filesystem in the container image we grabbed onto our linux userland
            filesystem and overlay, or in singularity terms <firstterm>bind</firstterm>
            <filename>/nscldaqinstall/opt-buster</filename> into <filename>/usr/opt</filename>
            in the container.
         </para>
         <para>
            Here's the singularity command to so so (assuming you grabbed
            nscl-buster.img):
         </para>
         <informalexample>
            <programlisting>

   /nscldaqinstall/nscl-buster.img
            </programlisting>
         </informalexample>
         <para>
            If you do this you should wind up with a shell and prompt that looks like:
            <literal>Singularity nscl-buster.img:~></literal> indicating you're
            executing inside the singularity container. Some things to note:

                  should contain the
                  NSCLDAQ installation directory tree you pulled over from the
                  NSCL and you can e.g.
                  <command>. /usr/opt/daq/12.0-000/daqsetup.bash</command>
                  to setup  the full set of NSCLDAQ environment variables will

            When you start a container,  you can specify additional bindings

            is where the directory tree being bound is located in the host filesystem
            and the optional <literal>dest</literal> is where that directory tree
            should appear in the container filesystem.  If the destination
            is not supplied, the source is bound to the same location it appears
            in the host.

            This program accepts two command line parameters.  The first is a logbook
            database file.  The concept of a selected logbook is only maintained
            by the <command>lg_xxxx</command> utilties and Tcl administrative
            API.  As an exercise for the reader, check for the file
            <filename>~/.nscl-logbook-current</filename> and read the logbook
            database filename from there.

                <para>
                  The <filename>LogBook.h</filename> file contains a definition
                  of much of the API.  Specifically, it contains the definition of

                <para>
                  This chunk of code ensures we have a logbook filename and
                  a key name to lookup.  If not we exit with a message
                  showing the user how to run the program.

                <para>
                  Many API functions report errors by throwing a

                     Having gotten an logbook instance "object" from the

                     object instance commands we get from the API.
                     For example, the logbook instance API subcomand

            <title>Using the high-level or administrative Tcl API</title>
            <para>
               As we've seen in the previous section, the low level Tcl API
               imposes a burden of manual object management.  This can be
               tricky even for experienced programmers.  It can be downright
               impossible to get right for most script writers that are not
               experienced at that issue.
            </para>
            <para>
               The administrative level or high level Tcl API does this 
               storage management for you by making objects that have only a very short,
               well defined 
               lifetime. All objects created during the execution of an API call
               are destroyed before that call exits or raises an error.
               This provides a much simpler procedural interface at the cost of
               excessive object construction/destruction (for example each
               call will open access to the database and destroy it),
            </para>
            <para>
               It is at this level, that the API provides the concept of a
               <firstterm>currently selected logbook</firstterm>, that we have
               seen in previous sections of this chapter.  The script we
               provide below will operate on the currently selected logbook
               rather than requiring a logbook on the command line.
               It will raise an error if there is not a currently selected
               logbook (any API call that requires a selected logbook will
               raise that error for us).
            </para>
            <para>
               Let's look at the resulting script:

                     This checks that the key exists.  It does this by creating

            The Python API provides an object oriented Python interface to the

            pull the logbook filename from <filename>~/.nscl-logbook-current</filename>)
            rather than from the command line.

            Note that the API is supported for Python 3 not Python 2. You must

          <para>
            <command>lg_create</command> creates a new logbook database file.
            The <option>-filename</option> is mandatory and is used to provide
            the name of a file to create.  It is an error to attempt to create
            a logbook into an existing file.  The remaining options are
            optional.  With the exception of <option>-current</option> they
            provide information about the logbook that will be put in the
            database's key value store.  
          </para>
          <para>
            <option>-current</option> requires a boolean parameter.  If this
            parameter is true, after creating the logbook, it is made the current
            logbook.  Boolean values can be any legal Tcl boolean value.

            Since experiments are staffed by people and artifacts in the logbook
            are associated with people, the people that can create artifacts
            must be made known to the database. This command adds a person
            to the database.
          </para>
          <para>
            A person is identified by their <parameter>lastname</parameter>,
            <parameter>firstname</parameter> and an optional
            <parameter>salutation</parameter>.
          </para>
          <para>
            If none of these are provided to the command, it switches to GUI
            mode and pops up a dialog box that allows people to be added to the
            database.  The dialog provides entries for the three fields that
            define a person (salutation can be left blank).  The
            <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button adds the person described and the
            <guibutton>Done</guibutton> button exits the dialog.
            Thus GUI Mode allows more than one person to be added in a
            single invocation of the command.

          <para>
            Shifts are collections of people.  Shifs are  intended to capture
            the concept that when experiment data taking is in progress,
            data taking time is normally divided in time blocks and each time
            block is manned by some subset of the people involved in data taking.
            When data taking state changes occur (e.g. a run starts), that
            state change is associated with the shift that was on duty at the
            time.
          </para>
          <para>
            Creates a new shift.  If the <parameter>shift-name</parameter>
            command parameter is created, an empty shift with that name
            is created.  If the <parameter>shift-name</parameter> is not
            provided, <command>lg_mkshift</command> switches to GUI mode
            and displays a dialog that allows you to both create a shift and
            stock it with members.  See the tutorial information on the logbook
            for a description of this dialog and how to use it.
          </para>
          <warning>
            <para>
               Once data taking has begun, shift membership should not be
               modified.  This is because state changes are associated with a
               shift name not with the collection of people that are members
               of that shift at the time of the state change.  Therefor editing
               shift members for a shift associated with a state change will
               also edit the set of people associated with that state change.

                     You can also use this subcommand to create a new shift
                     from the members of an existing shift. Simply edit the
                     shift you want to use as a starting point and set a new name
                     in the shift name box of the editor.

            The <command>lg_*</command> family of commands have the concept
            of a <firstterm>current shift</firstterm> (or on duty shift).
            All automatically logged state changes attribute the shift to
            the on-duty shift.  This command provides a mechanism to set the
            current shift.  If <parameter>shift-name</parameter> is not supplied,
            a shift selection dialog is displayed. Note that this dialog can
            remain displayed after the current shift is selected, providing for
            a permanently visible shift change dialog.

          <para>
            The logbook database provides a generic key value store.  This key
            value store contains information provided when the database is
            created but can also be used to associate arbitrary values with keywords.
            A sort of persistent array with textual indices.  The
            <command>lg_kvstore</command> command provides a command line
            utility to manipulate that store.

      <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
      <para>
        This class represents the top level C++ API for the logbook.
        In addition to providing the API, it encapsulates a nested
        public class: <classname>LogBook::Exception</classname> used
        to report errors via exceptions. 
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, for some operations,
        the logbook subsystem requires a directory in which to export
        data from the logbook database into the file system.  For example,
        when rendering a note as markup text with image references, the images
        themselves must live in the filesystem.  The member variable
        <classname>LogBook</classname>::<varname>m_tempdir</varname>
        contains the name of this directory.  Note that currently this is
        initially <filename>~/.nscl-logbook</filename>, however it is
        perfectly legal for a client program to alter that value to point
        to any other existing directory in the filesystem.
      </para>
      <para>
        The remainder of this manpage will first document the
        <classname>LogBook::Exception</classname> class and its methods
        and then the <classname>LogBook</classname> class itself.

      <title><classname>LogBook::Exception</classname> METHODS</title>
      <para>
         All errors detected by the logbook system are reported by throwing
         <classname>LogBook::Exception</classname> exceptions.  This exception
         is derived from <classname>std::exception</classname>.
         This section describes the methods (most importantly the
         mechanisms for constructing instancde) of this class.

                  Constructs an instance with the specified message.  The
                  message text is copied into internal object storage so the
                  lifetime of the message is not an instance as the call-stack
                  is unrolled.  This method is most convenient when the message
                  text is hard coded.

                  Constructs the exception given a reference to a
                  <classname>std::string</classname> object.  This is convenient
                  to use when the error message is programmatically constructed.
                  For example, within the library, a common pattern is to
                  instantiate an <classname>std::stringstream</classname> object

         <para>
            Shifts are collections of people.  In addition there's the concept
            of a current, or on-duty shift that, during data taking is associated
            with data taking state transitions.  Shifts are encapsulated by
            <classname>LogBookShift</classname> objects.
            <classname>LogBookShift</classname> is documented in
            <link linkend='daq3.logbookshift' endterm='daq3.logbookshift.title' />

            these methods, either individually or in vectors, point to
            dynamically allocated
            objects.  As such when no longer needed, they must be
            <literal>delete</literal>d in order to prevent memory leaks.

            This section of the API provides methods for creatin runs and

            All pointers to <classname>LogBookRun</classname> objects point
            to dynamically allocated objects. When you are done using them
            you must destroy them using <literal>delete</literal> to avoid
            application memory leaks.
         </para>
         <para>
            There is a coupling between shifts and runs.  Several of the
            methods in this section of the API log run state transitions.
            In order to succeed a current shift must have been
            established.  The current shift is associated with the state
            transition log entries.

            The logbook database includes a key value store.  A key value store
            is a table of keys and associated values.  They key value store
            is used to store metatdata about the logbook itself and can be
            used for simple application specific extension to the database to
            meet unanticipated use cases.  Key Value will be abbreviated KV below.

          <para>
            This class encapsulates a shift.  A shift is a collection of people
            that work on an experiment together during data taking.  Shifts are
            used to organize work during the highly time critical use of beam-time.
            At any given time a shift can be on duty or off duty.  At most one
            shift can be on duty.  The on-duty shift is referred to in this
            documentation as the <firstterm>current shift</firstterm>.
          </para>
          <para>
            This class includes methods that are not intended for general use
            but are invoked by <classname>LogBook</classname> methods to hide
            implementation details from that class.  These methods will be
            pointed out and are documented in case there's an overlooked use
            case that crops up where they may be useful at the application level.

          <para>
            Data taking is divided into time segments.  Each segment of data
            taking is called a <firstterm>run</firstterm>.  Runs and their
            state transitions (e.g. from active to ended) are logged in the
            logbook database.  This logging can be automated by using the
            <literal>logbookbundle</literal> package with the Readout GUI.

            In <link linkend='daq3.logbookshift' endterm='daq3.logbookshift.title' />
            we learned that shifts are collections of people and that a shift can
            be set to be the current shift.  When run state transitions are logged,
            the current shift is associated with that transition.  This allows
            us to know who was on duty during that segment of data taking.

            The <classname>LogBookShift</classname> encapsulates one run
            and its transition history in the logbook database.  We can think
            of a run as consisting of information about the run;
            the run number, run title, and a sequence of state transitions that
            each contain a transition type (e.g. begining the run), the time
            the transition was logged, the shift that was on-duty
            and, in the logbook, a short remark
            associated with the transition

      <title>METHODS</title>
      <para>
         Some of the methods described in this section are not intended for
         general use but serve to hide implementation details from the
         <classname>LogBook</classname> top level API class. Nevertheless, they are
         documented here in case some unanticipated use case arises that
         necessitates an application making use of them in a time-scale too urgent
         to allow the needed capabilities to be put in the top level API.
         These methods will be noted as not intended for general use in the
         documentation below.

             <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
          <para>
            Instances of <classname>LogBookNote</classname> encapsulate data
            in the database stored for a single note. Notes are considered to be
            a soup of rich text in Markdown format
            (see <ulink url='https://https://www.markdownguide.org/' />).
            A note has metadata that consists of an author, a timestamp that
            indicates when it was submitted to the database and optionally
            a run with which it's associated.
          </para>
          <para>
            As the Markdown syntax supports image file references, and we want
            our logbook databases to be self-contained, when a note is submitted,
            it is the authoring software's responsibility to submit the markdown
            along with a set of image filenames and the byte offset into the
            note text at which the image file reference begins.
            (the byte offset of the <literal>!</literal> in e.g.
            <literal>![some text](/image/file/path.jpg)</literal>).
          </para>
          <para>
            Methods are provided to obtain the note text, re-exporting the images
            into the logbook temporary directory and fixing up image references
            so that they work properly.  Image formats are not restricted by
            this software but only by the software used to view renderings of
            the markdown code (e.g. the web-browser for HTML renderings or
            acceptable LaTeX image formats for PDF).
          </para>
          <para>
            It is important to note that this class's rendering is limited to
            provding fixed-up markdown text. The problem of rendering this
            markdown into PDF or HTML and viewing it is pushed out onto
            user level software (e.g. <command>lg_print</command>
            or <command>lg_browse</command>).  Reasonable well developed Tcl
            support software has been developed and will be described in
            pages in the <literal>3tcl</literal> reference section.

      <title>METHODS</title>
      <para>
         Some of the methods described here are provide to hide implementation
         details from the <classname>LogBook</classname> class and not intended
         for general use.  These will be pointed out but documented for
         programmers of the logbook support software and to allow for
         use cases not-foreseen.

             <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
          <para>
            The <literal>logbook</literal> package provides access to NSCL
            logbook databases.  It provides the <command>logbook::logbook</command>
            command which can create and access databases.  
          </para>
          <para>
            A disadvantage of the <literal>logbook</literal> package is, that while
            it provides an object oriented interface to the C++ API, it places
            the burden of resource management directly on the script author.
            Generally, this is terra incongnita for a Tcl programmer.  If
            possible We recommend that you use the
            <link linkend='tcl3.logbookadmin' endterm='tcl3.logbookadmin.title' />
            package instead as that procedural interface does storage management
            for you.

            It's not possible for you to directly instantiate a logbook instance
            object. You obtain one from the <command>logbook::logbook</command>
            command.  See
            <link linkend='tcl3.logbook' endterm='tcl3.logbook.title' />.
            Logbook instances are command ensembles who's subcommand manipulate
            the logbook database they were connected to by the
            <command>logbook::logbook open</command> command.

                     When a logbook instance is not longer needed this subcommand
                     should be used to destroy it.

                     While, as you can see there are a couple of forms of this
                     command the meanings of the parameters across these forms
                     are the same.  In cases where items are not present, they are
                     not part of the note being created, for example
                     the fact that in both command forms <parameter>run</parameter>
                     is optional means that if it is not provided the note
                     is not associated with any run.  If <parameter>images</parameter>

                     no images are considered to be embedded in the note

            Provides an object oriented encapsulation of the data for a logbook
            person.  The data are cached in the object rather than fetched
            on demand from the database.  Since people are  write once objects,
            in general this is not a problem for scripts.
          </para>
          <para>
            All person instance commands are command ensembles.  See
            <literal>SUBCOMMANDS</literal> for the subcommands each instance
            provides.  It is important to note that when a person instance is
            no longer needed by the script its <literal>destroy</literal>
            subcommand must be called to avoid memory leaks.

          <para>
            A note instance is a Tcl command ensemble that provides access to
            all of the information contained in a note.  In general, as shown,
            you don't directly create a note ensemble but use one of the
            subcommands of a logbook instance to generate one or more instances.
            See
            <link linkend='tcl3.logbookinstance'
                  endterm='tcl3.logbookinstance.title' /> for subcommands that
            can generate notess
          </para>
          <para>
            Each note instance is a unique Tcl interpreter command and encapsulates
            specific resources.  As such, when no longer necessaryy, a note instance
            and its resources should be freed using its <literal>destroy</literal>
            subcommand.

                     This subcommand destroys the note instance. All resources
                     owned by the instance are destroyed.  Once the command
                     returns, the instance command is no longer a valid interpreter
                     command.

             <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
          <para>
            Using the low level logbook Tcl bindings can be painful because
            of the need to track the creation of instance commands and to ensure
            they get destroyed when on longer needed.  At the cost of making
            many more transient objects than otherwise required, the
            <literal>logbookadmin</literal> package provides a much easier
            to use interface to the logbook API.
          </para>
          <para>
            One of the features of <literal>logbookadmin</literal>, is that
            it adds the concept of a <firstterm>current logbook</firstterm> to
            the API.  The current logbook is the one that all commands
            will operate on, other than commands that can modify the
            current logbook.
          </para>
          <para>
            A feature of the <literal>logbookadmin</literal> API is that rather
            than returning command ensemble objects for complex objects,
            instead it returns dicts for them.  See
            <link linkend='tcl3.logbookadmin.dicts'
                  endterm='tcl3.logbookadmin.dicts.title'
                  />
            for a description of these dicts and their keys.
          </para>

      <title>COMMANDS</title>
      <para>
         The <literal>logbookadmin</literal> interface is procedural. The interface,
         therefore appears as simple commands.

               <parameter>members</parameter> as its members.
               The <parameter>members</parameter> list is a list of person
               primary keys (ids). These can be gotten from person dicts.
               To create an empty shift simply supply
               <literal>[list]</literal> as the
               <parameter>members</parameter> parameter to provide an
               emptylist.

               members are associated with run state changes so the shift
               members should remain constant once data taking has begun.

            This package provides some utilities that support high level note
            processing.  The package was written to support the note composition
            software, howver it may be used generally as well.

                  Creating a note requries that the images referenced by the
                  notes be included in the database to support later rendering.
                  <command>makeNoteImageList</command> takes the raw text of
                  a note, locates image references and creates a list of pairs,
                  one for each image reference.  The pairs are the the
                  byte offset at
                  which the image reference occurs in the text and the  filename
                  of the image itself.

                  a list of strings, where each string is an unreadable image file.
                  For a note to be imported, all image file references must
                  point to files that exist and are readable so they can be imported
                  into the database.

                  the markdown generated will be invalid but some renderers,
                  such as the PDF renderer may not be able to create output.

            This package provides utility commands that are used in the
            <command>lg_xxxx</command> logbook support commands but are also
            useable by any Tcl script that access the logbook.
          </para>
          <para>
            One note that there is a global variable in this package:
            <varname>timezone</varname>.  This variable contains the
            timezone string for the timezone in which the logbook was filled in.
            It is used in time formatting.  It defaults to
            <literal>:America/Detroit</literal> which is the timezone for
            FRIB/NSCL (East Lansing, Michgigan).  Which is eastern time with
            daylight saving time adjustments.  If your script is processing
            a logbook created at a different location, you can set this
            variable to get times formatted for that timezone.  Note as well
            that future logbook versions may write the timezone string into the
            logbook's KV store and use that for time formatting.

            the API allows construction of a <classname>LogBook.Logbook</classname>
            object on an existing logbook filename.
            Once constructed, that object
            provides several API subsections, each of these will be given its

                  Creates a shift and optionally stocks it with people.
                  The <parameter>name</parameter> parameter is mandatory and
                  is the new name to give to the shift.  Shift names must be
                  unique.  The optional <parameter>people</parameter>
                  parameter can be specified either positionally or by keyword
                  (<literal>people</literal>).  If provided it must be an
                  iterable Python object whose members are all
                  <classname>LogBook.Person</classname> people who will initially
                  be members of the shift.  Note that the
                  <classname>LogBook.Shift</classname> object that's returned
                  also provides methods that allow you to manipulate membership.
               </para>
               <para>
                  A caution here that shift membership should not change
                  once data taking starts.  This is because run state translations
                  get associated with a shift.  Therefore changing the membership of
                  a shift will change the logbook database's understanding
                  of who was on-duty at the time of the shift change.

                  This has meaning during data taking.  When run transitions
                  are logged, the current shift is associated with that transition.
                  This logs who was on duty and responsible for that transition.

                  is returned.

      <title>RUN API Section</title>
      <para>
         Runs are segments of data taking.  They are encapsulated with
         <classname>LogBook.Run</classname> objects. For more on those, see
         <link linkend='py3.run' endterm='py3.run.title' />.
         This part of the API provides the ability to create new runs, by beginning
         data taking, and retreive existing runs.  One of the most important
         bits of metadata associated with a run is its run number. Among recorded
         runs, this is a unique integer.  
      </para>
      <para>
         One other  key concept in the run API is that, natrually, data taking
         can only be active in one run at a time.  The logbook API enforces this
         by refusing to allow a run be created while another run is active.
         The active run, if there is one is called the
         <emphasis>current run</emphasis>.

            the associated <classname>LogBook.Transition</classname> which
            encapsulates a single run state transition.

          <para>
            <classname>LogBook.Note</classname> encapsulates a single
            logbook note.  Related to this class is
            <classname>LogBook.Image</classname> which encapsulates
            a single image.  Images can be fetched from a note object
            using <methodname>get_image</methodname>.
          </para>
          <para>
            Notes are stored in the logbook along with their associated images.
            The note text is assumed to be in Markdown format.  Image links,
            however point to image files that may or may not still be in the
            filesystem.  These images, however, have been pulled into the logbook
            database.  They can be exported back out into the filesystem and
            the raw note text image references fixed up to point to these exported
            images using <methodname>substitute_images</methodname>.
            Therefore the way to render a note is to first invoke
            substitute_image on the note to get usable Markdown from the note
            and then append or prepend any markdown headers or trailers desired
            (for example, <command>lg_browse</command> and
            <command>lg_print</command> prepend a table of note metadata), and
            then pass the resulting text to a mardown processor, such as
            <literal>Python-Markdown</literal>
            (<ulink url='https://python-markdown.github.io' />) for html output
            or <command>pandoc</command> for other output formats such
            as e.g. PDF.   NSCL Container images include pandoc
            (<ulink url='https://pandoc.org' /> -- packages exist as well for
            most Linux variants).

                     This method generates usable markdown from the raw note text
                     and
                     referenced images.  It does so by exporting referenced images to the
                     filesystem and fixing up the markdown links to them
                     to point at the exported images.  The return value of this
                     method is the fixed markdown text.  This text is suitable
                     to be rendered by a markdown processor.

            If you are reading this and you are not either an NSCLDAQ programming/maintainer
            or formulating a where clause for one of the API functions that
            accepts one, you've come to the wrong place.  Instead you should
            be looking at the API or language bindings for Python or Tcl.
            If you program directly to the database, you may not get some
            of the business logic of the logbook correct.

            The synpopsis shows the Sqlite3 commands that create the
            logbook databas schema.  This manpage will describe the contents
            of the tables and how they interrelate.  The tables fall into the
            following broad categories of interrelated tables with some relationships
            carried across these categories:

                     The <literal>kvstore</literal> table provides a generic
                     key value store.  This is initially stocked when the
                     database is created, however  the APIs in all languages
                     support manipulation of this store.

         This subset of data base tables provides definitions of the people

         groups of people that are on-duty concurrently during data taking
         (<literal>shift</literal> and <literal>shift_members</literal> tables).
         In addition while the experiment is running ther is a concept of a
         <literal>current_shift</literal>.  This indicates the shift that is
         on-duty currently.  The <literal>current_shift</literal> table is used

         linked to.

         The <literal>shift_members</literal> table is what is called a

         table in a many to many relationship.  That is a person can be in many shifts
         and a shift can have many members.  This table has no primary key,
         just two foreign keys:

         Finally, the <literal>current_shift</literal> table only ever has zero

         <type>INTEGER</type><structfield> shift_id</structfield>.  If there
         is an entry, the value of this field is the primary key of a shift.
         That shift is considered to be the current, or on-duty shift.

      <title>Runs</title>
      <para>
         Runs are a segment of data taking.  Runs have information that
         describes them and state transitions.  State transitions are associated
         with a shift.  Futhermore, as we will see, Runs can have notes
         associated with them.
      </para>
      <para>
         The database tables in this section are a bit involved.
         <literal>run</literal> and <literal>run_transitions</literal>
         provide tables to record each run and its sequence of transitions.
         The <literal>valid_transitions</literal> table provides textual names
         to go along with each transition type and <literal>valid_state_transitions</literal>
         provides the directed graph of valid transitions for each state
         (the result of a transition).  Finally, when a run is active (it has
         been started but not yet ended), <literal>current_run</literal>
         indicates this. 
      </para>
      <para>
         Under normal circumstances, a run is created and has an initial
         <literal>BEGIN</literal> transition indicating it has started.
         There may be other transitions but its final transition, if all goes
         well is an <literal>END</literal> transition indicating the run ended
         normally.  Data acquisition system failures can prevent a good
         <literal>END</literal> from being logged for the current run.
         A transition called <literal>EMERGENCY_END</literal> is, therefore
         defined that operates identically to <literal>END</literal> but indicates
         the run ended improperly.

         Notes are items containing arbitrary rich text.  The text is formatted
         using the <literal>Markdown</literal> formatting language.
         Markdown supports references to images that are in the filesystem.
         The notes themselves are in the <literal>note</literal> table.  The
         <literal>note_image</literal> table will store data in image files
         that are referenced by notes.
      </para>
      <para>
         Rendering a note requires transforming
         the text stored in the database or <firstterm>raw text</firstterm> by
         first exporting the image files it references back out into the
         file system and then fixing up references to images in the original
         raw text to properly reference the exported images.  API calls support
         doing that.
